This project was conducted for the course Data Analytics II - Causal Econometrics at the University of St. Gallen

This is a simulation study that investigates the performance of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) estimator. Both estimators are tested with three different data generating processes that attempt to reveal the potential strengths and weaknesses of the two estimators. Both estimators show difficulty with specific data generating processes but surprisingly do not break down when assumptions of the research design are violated.
